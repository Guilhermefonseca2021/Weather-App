# Weather API

This is the repository for the Weather API, a web application that consumes weather data from a weather API and provides real-time weather information for a specified location. The Weather API is a powerful tool for developers to integrate weather data into their applications, websites, or services.

## Features

- Provides information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- Supports multiple units of measurement (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).
- Allows users to search for weather information by city name, ZIP code, or geographic coordinates.

## How to use

1. Obtain an API key from a weather API provider. Popular weather API providers include OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit, and AccuWeather.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Open the `config.js` file and replace the placeholder `API_KEY` with your actual API key.

4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

5. Enter a location in the search field (e.g., city name, ZIP code, coordinates).

6. Click the "Get Weather" button to retrieve the current weather data for the specified location.

7. The weather information will be displayed on the screen, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
